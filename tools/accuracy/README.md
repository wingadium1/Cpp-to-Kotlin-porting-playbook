# LST Accuracy Tools (Structural Fidelity)

Validate a C++ â†’ Kotlin port by comparing the structure of the source and ported files via Lossless Semantic Trees (LSTs).

## Components
- `lst_accuracy.py`: Tokenizes and compares LSTs between C++ and Kotlin to detect structural drift.

## Usage
First, produce LSTs using the `tools/lst` workflow. Then run:
```sh
python3 tools/accuracy/lst_accuracy.py \
	--cpp-lst tools/lst/out/<cpp_file>.lst.json \
	--kotlin-lst /path/to/kotlin/<file>.lst.json \
	--mapping tools/porting/PROJECT_MAPPING.template.json
```

Non-zero exit indicates a structural token multiset mismatch. Use `--top` to limit diff output.

### Producing Kotlin-side LSTs
This playbook is language-agnostic on the ported side. You can:
- Generate LSTs using your Kotlin AST tooling and export to the same JSON-ish structure the tokenizer can read, or
- Convert another structural representation into a JSON map/list structure with fields like `kind/type`, `name/identifier`, and nested arrays/objects. The comparator is schema-light and will extract signals from these common fields.
