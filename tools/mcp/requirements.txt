# MCP Requirements

The MCP server implementation requires the Model Context Protocol package:

```bash
pip install mcp
```

For development and testing:

```bash
pip install mcp[dev]
```

Note: The current `server.py` is a template showing the structure. A production implementation would need proper MCP integration and AI model connectivity for chunk conversion.
